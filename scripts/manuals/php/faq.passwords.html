      Password hashing is one of the most basic security considerations that
      must be made when designing any application or service that accepts passwords
      from users. Without hashing, any passwords that are stored
      can be stolen if the data store is compromised, and
      then immediately used to compromise not only the application or service, but also
      the accounts of users on other services, if they do not use
      unique passwords.
     </p>
     <p class="simpara">
      By applying a hashing algorithm to the user&#039;s passwords before storing
      them, it becomes implausible for any attacker to
      determine the original password, while still being able to compare
      the resulting hash to the original password in the future.
     </p>
     <p class="simpara">
      It is important to note, however, that hashing passwords only protects
      them from being compromised in the data store, but does not necessarily
      protect them from being intercepted by malicious code injected into the
      application or service itself.

      Hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 are designed to be
      very fast and efficient. With modern techniques and computer equipment,
      it has become trivial to <q class="quote">brute force</q> the output of these algorithms,

     <p class="simpara">
      Because of how quickly a modern computer can <q class="quote">reverse</q> these hashing

     <p class="simpara">
      When hashing passwords, the two most important considerations are the
      computational expense, and the salt. The more computationally expensive
      the hashing algorithm, the longer it will take to brute force its
      output.

     <p class="simpara">
      PHP provides
      <a href="book.password.html" class="link">a native password hashing API</a> that
      safely handles both <a href="function.password-hash.html" class="link">hashing</a>
      and <a href="function.password-verify.html" class="link">verifying passwords</a>
      in a secure manner.
     </p>
     <p class="simpara">
      The suggested algorithm to use when hashing passwords is Blowfish, which
      is also the default used by the password hashing API, as it is
      significantly more computationally expensive than MD5 or SHA1, while
      still being scalable.
     </p>
     <p class="simpara">
      The <span class="function"><a href="function.crypt.html" class="function">crypt()</a></span> function is also available for password
      hashing, but it is only recommended for interoperability with other
      systems.
      Instead, it is strongly encouraged to use the
      <a href="book.password.html" class="link">native password hashing API</a>
      whenever possible.

      A cryptographic salt is data which is applied during the hashing process
      in order to eliminate the possibility of the output being looked up
      in a list of pre-calculated pairs of hashes and their input, known as
      a rainbow table.
     </p>
     <p class="simpara">
      In more simple terms, a salt is a bit of additional data which makes
      hashes significantly more difficult to crack. There are a number of
      services online which provide extensive lists of pre-computed hashes, as
      well as the original input for those hashes. The use of a salt makes it
      implausible or impossible to find the resulting hash in one of these
      lists.

     <p class="simpara">
      <span class="function"><a href="function.password-hash.html" class="function">password_hash()</a></span> will create a random salt if one
      isn&#039;t provided, and this is generally the easiest and most secure
